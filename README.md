# Pretty Table 🐠

Create a "functional" table (like a spread sheet) where rows can be filtered, sorted, and the table paginated.

User can sort (eg: clicking on the column header)
User can filter/search (input-field)
User can determine the number of entries per page
User can change pages
User can hide/show columns (think of how to do this in a good way)
An example JSON file is provided as the data source

Code
- Emphasis is placed on functionality and code quality
- Optional: Attractive design - Surprise us with your UI/UX skills 😀
- Optional: Mobile-friendly design: think about how to make the table responsive
